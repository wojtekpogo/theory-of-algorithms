# Theory of Algorithms
___

## Why this repo exists?

This repository is a project demonstrating that I have achieved the learning outcomes of this module along with some sample work and various examples.

## What you will find in this repository?


This repository contains the work from Theory of Algorithms Module. It consists of:

* *post-correspondence* - Contains a definition and explanation of **Post Correspondence Problem** and **Bounded Post Correspondence Problem** as well as Python function which solves the **Bounded PCP**. The function takes two lists of strings and returns ***True*** if they correspond, ***False*** otherwise. This notebook also contains an explanation of what an undecidable problem is in computability theory.

* *countdown* - Contains an overview, explanation and discusses the complexity of the **Countdown Numbers Game**. It also contains Python function written in a [functional programming style](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html) which solves a **Countdown Numbers Game**.

* *Labs* - Folder contains the notebooks with all the work throughout the semester
